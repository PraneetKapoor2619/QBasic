QBasic Codes

I started learning about QBasic in summer of 2018. I was motivated to learn it because I read how in 1980's some old school games and program (like "CookBook Management programs") were written in it. However, my interest in this language was shortlived. It, for some reason, felt silly and lacked structure which C has. Anyways, I did Dr. Chuck's course 'Python for Everybody" in the summer of 2020, which:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. made me realise how Python is just like a modern version of BASIC but many folds more useful and powerful.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. gave me a tool which I can use to quickly compute and plot various functions  
  
The last time I used QBasic was to write a program for deciphrying a 4 digit password which Bob wrote during an episode of Stranger Things Season 2. Clearly, not knowing BASIC in depth has not been a disadvantge for me.
